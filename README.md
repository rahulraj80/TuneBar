## 💾 Customizing Radio & Music (SD Card)

### 📻 Radio Stations

To manage your radio station list, you can create a `station.csv` file and upload it via the SD card.

An example `station.csv` is available in the `/sketch/data` folder.

### CSV Format
The file should contain one station per line in the format: `Station Name,URL`.
**Note:** Only `http` URLs are supported; `https` is not allowed.

**Example [stations.csv](https://github.com/VaAndCob/TuneBar/blob/main/sketch/data/stations.csv):**
```csv
BBC Radio 1,http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_one
Smooth Chill,http://media-the.musicradio.com/SmoothChillMP3
```

### How to Upload
1.  Create or Edit the `station.csv` file on your computer.
2.  Copy the file to the root directory of a FAT32 formatted microSD card.
3.  Insert the SD card into the TuneBar device.
4.  To upload, go to the **Config -> Radio** tab and click **UPLOAD**.


### 🎶 Media Player Support

TuneBar supports playback of MP3, AAC, FLAC, and WAV files.

To use this feature, copy your media files to the SD card. The system supports folder structures up to 5 levels deep.
Go to the **Config -> Music** tab, then click **LOAD** to index the music files.

## 🧘 Quick start, flash and go, no code needed
